| Code                 | What it does                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `import AppRoutes`   | Brings in your routing logic from `AppRoutes.jsx`    |
| `<AppRoutes />`      | Loads the correct page (like LoginPage) based on URL |
| `export default App` | Makes the app usable in `main.jsx`                   |

when the app loads, it will go through
